# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome issues, suggestions, and pull requests.

## Quick Start
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Set up Android Studio (Giraffe+), Kotlin 2.0.0, and latest Compose BOM.
3. Open `app` module to run the sample and test your changes.
4. Make edits in the `persiandatepicker` library module.
5. Write clear commit messages (Conventional Commits recommended: feat, fix, docs, refactor, chore).
6. Open a Pull Request with a concise description and screenshots if UI changes.

## Guidelines
- Keep public API names clear and consistent.
- Add KDoc for new public APIs.
- Match existing code style and formatting.
- Ensure no new warnings or lint errors.
- Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` when relevant.

## Reporting Issues
- Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and device/Android version.
- Attach screenshots or screen recordings where possible.

Thanks again for contributing!
